# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION-USING-ML

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using machine learning techniques. It was implemented in Google Colab using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and nltk. The dataset used consists of news articles labeled as fake or real. The data was preprocessed by cleaning text, removing stopwords, and applying tokenization. Different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine were trained and evaluated for classification performance. The system predicts whether a given news article is genuine or fake based on its content. This project demonstrates the application of natural language processing and supervised learning in solving real-world problems related to misinformation and online content verification.
